good morning everyone, I am Navaditya Singh Rana and I am the leader of Team Basilisk.
In the last few days, me and my team have been working(change to slide 2) on a new, next generation learning platform called Ignosis.
It is derived from greek word for knowledge- I gnosi.
Ignosis is an online learning platform designed to make learning programming fun and interactive.
Ignosis aims to inspire a passion for learning by adopting a gamified model of learning using features like leaderboards, badges
and other rewards. 
but how exactly do we achieve such a task. The solution is three fold

penetration power and ionizing power.

i think ionizing power cuz they really destroy dna molecules
